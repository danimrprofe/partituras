Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
ESTROFA
                G                    C
I know your favorite song I hear it every day
          Em                            C
Whoever made your smile. Made it to get in my way
          G              G/F#          Em
And every time you laugh You make that little sound
              C                                D
It's just the hardest thing. To love you, but not know how

   Am                                  Em
So, I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
             G                         Am              
'Cause I've tried to forget you. But these things 
      Em         C
just don't go away

                    Em                   C
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
                 G                      D/F#
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
                             Em                       C
That we were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
                   G                   D
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
                          C   D                   G
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
                      C    D                    G
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

Am                                                   Em
What good are words When they always just get in our way?
    C                                                       G        D
And it hurts the most just to know That you don't feel the same, the same
       Am                                                      Em
So sometimes, I get down on my knees and I pray things will change
     C                        C                             G        D
But life is what happens when things They don't work out our way, our way

   Am                                    Em
So, I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
             G                         Am7              Em7         C
'Cause I've tried to forget you. But these things just don't go away

                    Em                   C
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
                 G                      G/F#
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
                             Em                       C
That we were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
                   G                   D
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
                          C   D                   G
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
                      C    D                    G
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
