Verse 1:
 
Em    Bm                D        Am
   Tonight we drink to youth and holding fast to truth,
Em         Bm                D            Am
   Don't want to lose what I had as a boy,
Em   Bm               D       Am
   My heart still has a beat but love is now a feat,
Em    Bm           D           Am
   As common as a cold day in L.A.
 
 
Pre-Chorus 1:
 
    Am                                C
Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder is there a spell that I am under
Am                           C         D
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
 
 
Chorus 1:
 
Em     Bm            D              Am
Love hurts but sometimes it's a good hurt 
        Em         Bm     A  C
And it feels like I'm alive
Em      Bm          D                 C
Love sings when it transcends the bad things
       Em        Bm              A              C
Have a heart and try me cause without love I won't survive
 
 
Verse 2:
 
Em    Bm            D          Am
   Fettered and abused stand naked and accused 
Em        Bm               D            Am
   Should I surface this one man submarine?
Em   Bm                 D      Am
   I only want the truth so tonight we drink to youth
Em      Bm              D             Am
   I'll never lose what I had as a boy
 
 
Pre-Chorus 2:
 
     Am                                 C
 Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder, is there a spell that I am under
  Am                            C      D
 Keeping me from seeing the real thing?
 
 
Chorus 2:
 
Em     Bm            D              Am
Love hurts but sometimes it's a good hurt 
        Em         Bm     A  C
And it feels like I'm alive
Em      Bm          D                 C
Love sings when it transcends the bad things
       Em        Bm              A              C
Have a heart and try me cause without love I won't survive

And it feels like I'm alive

Love sings when it transcends the bad things
