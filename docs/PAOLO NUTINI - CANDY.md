          Am				    Em					 
I was perched outside in the pouring rain Trying to make myself a sail.
            G	
Then I'll float to you my darlin' with 
	D			                
the evening on my tail. 
                  Am				   
Although not the most honest means of travel
    Em
It gets me there nonetheless
          G					         D7
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe and a helpless one at best

                    G              D7			       Am	
Just give me some candy, before I go. Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes

eyes and lay you down on your rug. Just give me some candy after my hug
ESTROFA
        Am					          	   Em
Oh, I'm often found explaining but to her it plays out all the same
          G					         D7
and although I'm left defeated It gets held against my name
                Am		  		      
I know you got plenty to offer baby 
         Em
But I guess I've taken quite enough
                G				    		       
Well, I'm some stain there on your bedsheet 
            D
You're my diamond in the rough
