Lenny Kravitz
 
 
[Intro]
Asus2     F#m11
E       D
 
 
[Verse]
D                          E      F#
I’ve been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I’ve never heard a yearning quite
Like this before
Know that you are
Walking right through my door
 
 
[Chorus]
Asus2       F#m11              E
All of my life where have you been
              D
I wonder if I’ll ever see you again
And if that day comes, I know we could win
I wonder if I’ll ever see you again
 
 
[Verse]
A sacred gift from heaven
For better worse whenever
And I would never let somebody
Break you down
Or take you crown,
Never
 
 
[Chorus]
Asus2       F#m11              E
All of my life where have you been
              D
I wonder if I’ll ever see you again
And if that day comes, I know we could win
I wonder if I’ll ever see you again
 
 
[Bridge] (a cappella)
Am
(Through time)
I’ve always known
           Em
(That you were there) 
Upon your throne
(A lonely queen)
Without her king
(I longed for you)
My love, forever!
 
 
[Solo]
Asus2   F#m11
E    D
 
[Chorus] (2x)
 
 
[Outro] (2x)
A   A7            D         Dm
I wonder if I’ll ever see you again
 
Have fun!
