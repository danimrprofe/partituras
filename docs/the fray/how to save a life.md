Tuning: E A D G B EKey: BbCapo: 3rd fret
[Verse 1]
 
G                    D
Step one you say we need to talk
    Em                 D        D      G
He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             D              Em
He smiles politely back at you
             D       D         G
You stare politely right on through
               D             Em
Some sort of window to your right
             D       D         G
As he goes left and you stay right
              D                Em
Between the lines of fear and blame
                   D     D
And you begin to wonder why you came
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                 D
Let him know that you know best
      Em            D
Cause after all you do know best
G                D
Try to slip past his defense
Em               D
Without granting innocence
G          D
Lay down a list of what is wrong
Em                D
The things you’ve told him all along
G                  D
And pray to God he hears you
    Em             D
And pray to God he hears you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life
 
 
[Verse 3]
G               D
As he begins to raise his voice
    Em              D
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
G               D
Drive until you lose the road
Em                           D
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
G          D
He will do one of two things 
Em               D
He will admit to everything
G                      D
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
Em                  D
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D       C    D  Em
Had I known how to save a life
G      D      C     D   Em
How to save a life
G      D      C
How to save a life 
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D      G
Had I known how to save a life
  C             D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G          D      G
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             G     D       C    D  Em
Had I known how to save a life
