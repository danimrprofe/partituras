SNOW PATROL 
YOU COULD BE HAPPY
Mejor bajar y capo 3

F 1 bar  C 1 bar  A# 2bars x4
 
[Chorus]
 
             F         C       A#
You could be happy and I won't know
                          F     C           A#
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
                          F      C       A#
And all the things that I wish I had not said
                             F       C     A#
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
 
 
[Verse]
 
                  Gm         F     A#
Is it too late to remind you how we were?
                         Gm      F        A#
But not our last days of silent, screaming blur
               Gm       F        A#
Most of what I remember makes me sure
                               F       C       A#
I should have stopped you from walking out the door
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             F        C        A#
You could be happy, I hope you are
            F            C           A#
You made me happier than I'd been by far
                   F     C         A#
Somehow everything I own smells of you
                   F            C       A#
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
 
 
[Verse]
 
                       Gm     F      A#
Do the things that you always wanted to
                         Gm        F            A#
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
                     Gm      F      A#
More than anything I want to see you go
                F           C         A#
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
