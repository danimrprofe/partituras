[Verse 1]
Am7               G  C/E
  Came in for the embers
Fadd9
 Stayed out for the breeze
          Am7                 G   C/E
I need to feel elements to remind me
Fadd9
 There's beauty when it's bleak
Am7          G          C/E
  Stuck out long before lights down
Fadd9                          Fadd9
 Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
 
 
[Chorus]
                C         G           F
The more that I love, the less that I feel
                 C      G          F
The times that I jumped never were real
                  C          G           Fadd9    Am7
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
G       F
Maybe I won't
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am7                    G  C/E
  Stones crash on the boardwalk
Fadd9
 The wind rush through the trees
                  Am7
I'll keep my eyes peeled
                     G  C/E
The memories always fall short
Fadd9
 Of what we could've been
Am7       G  C/E
  Let out long before last call
Fadd9
 What do I need? Oh, I know
 
 
[Chorus]
                C         G           F
The more that I love, the less that I feel
                 C      G          F
The times that I jumped never were real
                  C          G           Fadd9    Am7
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
G       F
Maybe I won't
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
 
 
[Chorus]
                C         G           Fadd9
The more that I love, the less that I feel
                 C      G          Fadd9
The times that I jumped never were real
                  C          G           Fadd9   Am7
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
G       F
Maybe I won't
        C     C/D   C/E   G/B    Fadd9
But the waves won't break my boat
