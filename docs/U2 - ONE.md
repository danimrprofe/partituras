Am               Dsus2          Fmaj7                     G
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without

Well it's too late  tonight. To drag the past out into the light
C                   Am            Fmaj7                        C

[Verse 3]
Am                          Dsus2
  Have you come here for forgiveness?
Fmaj7                           G
     Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                           Dsus2
  Have you come here to play Jesus
Fmaj7                      G
     To the lepers in your head?
 
C                  Am
 Did I ask too much  more than a lot
Fmaj7                            C
     You gave me nothing now it's all I got
C                    Am
  We're one but we're  not the same
       Fmaj7                        C
Well we     hurt each other then we do it again
 
 
       C                   Am
You Say Love is a temple, Love a higher law
 C                 Am
Love is a temple, Love the higher law
    C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
                         Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on     to what you got
                     C           Am
When all you got is hurt one love  one blood
Fmaj7                    C
     One life you got to do what you should
        Am               Fmaj7       C
One life  with each other     Sisters brothers
                  Am
One life but we're  not the same
         Fmaj7                    C
We get to     carry each other carry each other
