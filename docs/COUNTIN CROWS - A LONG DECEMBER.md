A long December and there's reason to believe. 
       A#                F               A#
Maybe this year will be better than the last
Gm          A#         F                  C	                    
I can't remember the last thing that you said 
             Gm		        F             A#
as you were leavin' Now the days go by so fast
ESTRIBILLO
         F               A#         Gm    A#		
And it's one more day up in the canyons. 
         F                  A#       Gm
And it's one more night in Hollywood
         F                A#      Gm -stop- 		
If you think you might come to California...
              F	  A#   Gm  A#   F   A#   Gm
I think you should nanananananananana. Yeah

A#             F            C           Gm		
The smell of hospitals in Winter. 
         A#                F               A#
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
Gm       A#           F                 C		            
All at once you look across a crowded room 
            Gm		        F          A#
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
ESTRIBILLO
         F               A#         Gm    A#		
And it's one more day up in the canyons. 
         F                  A#       Gm
And it's one more night in Hollywood
         F                A#      Gm -stop- 		
If you think you might come to California...
              F	  A#   Gm  A#   F   A#   Gm
I think you should nanananananananana. Yeah

Drove up to the Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m. And talked a little while about the year
Gm          A#                F              C
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
          Gm            F		    A#
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
                A#      F                  C            Gm
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
