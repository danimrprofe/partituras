3 DOORS DOWN 
BE LIKE THAT
ESTROFA
G                            D		Em                             C
He spends his nights in California, Watching the stars on the big screen
G                            D	   Em                C
Then he lies awake and he wonders, why can't that be me?
G				              D
Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
Em			               C                         G
He's left a lot of things He'd rather not mention right now
                          D			
But just before he says goodnight, 
Em                   C
He looks up with a little smile at me, and he says...
ESTRIBILLO
G                   D				 	Em                 
If I could be like that, I would give anything 
                  C
Just to live one day, in those shoes
G                   D				Em                C
If I could be like that, what would I do, what would I do?

G                                D
She spends her days up in the north park,
Em                            C
Watching the people as they pass
G                              D
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream,
Em                   C
Is that too much to ask?
        G                D
With a safe home, and a warm bed,
Em                   C
On a quiet little street
G                            D
All she wants is just that something to
            Em             C
Hold onto, that's all she needs. Yeah!
