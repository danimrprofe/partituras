[Verse]
  C#                F#
I woke up, it was seven
  G#             F#
Waited till eleven
             C#           F#          G#- F#
Just to figure out that no one would call.
             C#             F#
I think I've got a lot of friends
    G#                 F#
But I don't hear from them.
C#               F#        G#
What's another night all alone?
              D#m          F#          G#
When you're spending every day on your own

And here it goes ..


[Chorus]
C#          F#        G#
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
C#          F#         G#           F#
I'm just a kid and I know that it's not fair
D#m          F#         C#               G#
Nobody cares  cause I'm alone and the world
D#m             F#      G#
Is havin' more fun than me

Tonight


[Interlude]
C#– F#– G#– F#


[Verse]
            C#               F#
And maybe when the night is dead
      G#            F#
I'll crawl into my bed
  C#              F#            G#– F#
Staring at these four walls again
              C#             F#
I'll try to think about the last time
G#         F#
  I had a good time,
 C#             F#            G#
Everyone's got somewhere to go
              D#m           F#         G#
And they're gonna leave me here on my own

And here it goes


[Chorus]
C#          F#        G#
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
C#          F#         G#           F#
I'm just a kid and I know that it's not fair
D#m          F#         C#               G#
Nobody cares  cause I'm alone and the world
D#m             F#      G#
Is havin' more fun than me


[Bridge]
F#
What the fuck is wrong with me?
  G#               
Dont fit in with anybody
C#                  G# C#    F#– C#
How did this happen to me?
F#                           G#          C#  
Wide awake, I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
    D#m                                  G#
And every night is the worst night ever

C#– F#– G#– F#
I'm just a kid (just a kid) x5


[Chorus]
C#           F#      G#
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
C#           F#        G#           F#
I'm just a kid and I know that it's not fair
D#m         F#          C#             G#
Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is ..
D#m         F#        G#
Nobody wants to be alone and the world
C#           F#      G#
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
C#           F#      G#             F#
I'm just a kid and I know that it's not fair
D#m         F#           C#            G#
Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is ..
D#m         F#       C#
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
D#m         F#           C#            G#
Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is
D#m         F#       G#
Having more fun than me, tonight
