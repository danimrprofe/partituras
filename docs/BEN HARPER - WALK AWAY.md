ESTROFA
G5 G5/F#              G5/E      G5/F#
Oh no, here comes that sun again
G5                G5/F#        G5/E          G5/F#
That means another day, without you my friend
      G5          G5/F#         G5/E        G5/F#
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
G5               G5/F#            G5/E             G5/F#
And it hurts even more, to have to be with somebody else
ESTRIBILLO
      G5/C         G5/B       G5/A       G5
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
   G5/C         G5/B             G5/A             G5
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
G5/C G5/B G5/A G5/F#
Walk away
ESTROFA
G5              G5/F# G5/E            G5/F#
With so many people to love in my life
  G5       G5/F#   G5/E G5/F#
Why do I worry about one
     G5        G5/F# G5/E  G5/F#
But you put the happy in my ness
 G5             G5/F#      G5/E   G5/F#
You put the good times into my fun
ESTRIBILLO 
      G5/C         G5/B       G5/A       G5
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
   G5/C         G5/B             G5/A             G5
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
     G5/C G5/B             G5/A G5/F#
Walk away, and head for the door
PUENTE
Am               Em    G5       D/F#
We've tried the goodbye so many days
        Am             Em              G5               D/F#
We walk in the same direction, so that we could never stray
      Am                  Em                  G5              D/F#
They say if you love somebody, then you have got to set them free
    Am                 Em                 D/F#                     G5 G5/F# G5/E 
But I would rather be locked to you, than live in this pain and misery
G5/F#
ESTROFA
G5      G5/F#         G5/E           G5/F#
They say time will make all this go away
          G5                     G5/F#        G5/E                  G5/F#
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows, and turned them into yesterdays
G5       G5/F#            G5/E               G5/F#
And once again that rising sun is dropping on down
    G5        G5/F#           G5/E      G5/F#
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found
ESTRIBILLO
      G5/C         G5/B       G5/A       G5
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
   G5/C           G5/B           G5/A             G5
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
     G5/C G5/B             G5/A G5
Walk away, and head for the door
              G5/C G5/B G5/A G5/F#
You just walk away
       G5 G5/F# G5/E G5/F#
Walk away
       G5 G5/F# G5/E G5/F#
Walk away
             G5     G5/F#                    G5/E G5/F#
Just walk on, walk on, turn and head for the door
            G5 G5/F# G5/E G5/F#
Just walk away
