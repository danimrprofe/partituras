All day Staring at the ceiling making. 
C            D              Em
Friends with shadows on my wall
C     D          G              Em 
All night. I'm hearing voices telling me
     C
That I should get some sleep
                  D
Because tomorrow might be good for something

Bm  C         G                 D
Hold on. I'm feeling like I'm headed for a
Bm  C      G            D
Breakdown. I don't know why
ESTRIBILLO
G                                 C
I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell. 
N.C.
I know right now you can't tell
Em                                     D
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see. 
N.C.
A different side of me
G                                  C
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired. 
N.C.
I know right now you don't care
Em                                    D

N.C.
and how I used to be

C     D     G           Em             C            D              Em
      Me. Talking to myself in public. And dodging glances on the train
C     D     G              Em           C            D              Em
I know. I know they've all been talking 'bout me. I can hear them whisper
          D
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

Bm  C     G                     D
With me. Out of all the hours thinking
Bm  C      G            D
Somehow. I've lost my mind

G                                 C

Talking in my sleep
