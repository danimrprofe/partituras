ESTROFA
G                   D/F#             Em7              D/F#      
Step one you say we need to talk He walks you say sit down it's just a 
G               D/F#              Em7            D/F#                G
Talk. He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through
              D/F#           Em7              D/F#               G
Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right
              D/F#            Em7                    D/F#
Between the lines of fear and blame And you begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
C              D               E m                G           D/F#
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em               G*     D/F#*
And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a 
G
life

ESTROFA
G              D/F#      Em7          D/F#
Let him know that you know best Cause after all you do know best
G              D/F#  Em7          D/F#
Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence
G              D/F#          Em7          D/F#
Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along
G              D/F#  Em7          D/F#
Pray to God he hears you And I pray to God he hears you, and
 
[Chorus]
C              D               E m                G           D/F#
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em               G*     D/F#*
And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a

    G            D/F#               Em7              D/F#          
As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last 
G                      D/F#              Em7                  
Choice.Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones you've 
D/F#     G          D/F#              Em7               D/F#
Followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything
    G                  D/F#              Em7            D/F#
Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came
