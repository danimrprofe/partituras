A D/A               A
     I guess I just feel like
 
 
[Verse 1]
D/A               A
   I guess I just feel like
D/A         F#m              D
   Nobody's honest, nobody's true
           F#m                D
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
               A        D/A                A   D/A
I guess I just feel like   I'm the same way too

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
 
 
[Verse 2]
               A        D/A                A
I guess I just feel like   good things are gone
D/A                     A      D/A                    A
   And the weight of my worries   is too much to take on
D/A            F#m                    D
   I think I remember the dream that I had
                  F#m                             D
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
               A
I guess I just feel like
D/A                 A    D/A
   What happened to that?

[Verse 3]
D/A               A        D/A                   A
   I guess I just feel like   the joke's gettin' old
D/A                  A     D/A                  A
   And the future is fading   and the past is on hold
D/A                    F#m                     D
   But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
                    F#m                   D
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
            F#m                      D
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
               A        D/A            A  D/A
I guess I just felt like   givin' up today

     Mmm, yeah, yeah
