WONDERFUL TONIGHT
ESTROFA
G                D        C                      D
It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear.
G               D         C               D
She puts on her make-up, and brushes her long, blonde hair.

C            D         G       D     Em
And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
           C              D           G D C D
And I say "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."
ESTROFA
G           D       C            D
We go to a party, and everyone turns to see
G                D     C              D
This beautiful lady, who's walking around with me
ESTRIBILLO
C              D        G          D      Em
And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
             C            D           G       D   C   D
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."

C                 D            G                      Em
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
         C            D           C                 D
And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize
           G         D   C   D
How much I love you.
ESTROFA
G                D        C                D
It's time to go home now, and I've got an aching head
G                 D           C                   D
So, I give her the car keys, and she helps me to bed

C          D         G     D            Em
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
          C                   D          G   D/F#  Em
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight."
        C                    D            G
Oh, "My darling, you were wonderful to-night."
