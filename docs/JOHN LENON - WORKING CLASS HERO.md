JOHN LENON

Am
 
 
[Verse 1]
                             G             Am
As soon as you're boorn they make you feel small.
                        G            Am
By giving you no time instead of it all.
                                  G           Am
'Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
 
 
[Chorus]
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 2]
                 G              D          Am
They hurt you at hoome and they hit you at school.
                               G           Am
They hate if you're clever and despise a fool
                                    G              Am
'Till you're so fucking crazy can't follow their rules
 
 
[Chorus]
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 3]
                       G              D          Am
When they tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
                        G          Am
Then they expect you to pick a caree r
                                      G            Am
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
 
 
[Chorus]
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 4]
                        G          D            Am
Keep you drugged with religion and sex and tee vee
                                   G                Am
And you think you're so clever and classless and free.
                                     G              Am
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
 
 
[Chorus]
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be

[Verse 5]
                    G            D           Am
There's room at the top, they're telling you still.
                                G              Am
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill.
                             G              Am
If you wanna be like all the folks on the hill.
 
 
[Chorus]
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am
A working class hero is something to be
                G       D             Am

                G       D             Am G
