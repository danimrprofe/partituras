He said "Son, have you seen the world? Well, what would you say if I said that you could?

We marched and we sang. We all became friends as we learned how to fight

A hero of war, yeah that's what I'll be, and when I come home. They'll be damn proud of me.

I'll carry this flag, to the grave if I must. 'Cause it's a flag that I love, and a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door I yelled my commands. The children, they cried, but I got my man

We took him away   A bag over his face from his family and his friends

They took off his clothes. They pissed in his hands, I told them to stop, but then I joined in
                 Fmaj7                       C                   G
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once, but again and again

 So, I lifted my gun And I fired away And the shells jumped through the smoke And into the sand
