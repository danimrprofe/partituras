COUNTIN CROWS
HARD CANDY
Capo 2
D             G          D/F#               Em            D
 On certain Sundays in November when the weather bothers me
(D)     G                D/F#                Em            D
I empty drawers of other summers where my shadows used to be
(D)        G               D/F#             Em             D
And she is standing by the water as her smile begins to curl
(D)        G           D/F#          Em7
In this or any other summer she is something altogether different
Em7
Never just an ordinary girl  [riff]

D            G               D/F#             Em              D
And in the evenings on Long Island when the colours start to fade
             G            D/F#                Em                D
She wears a silly yellow hat that someone gave her when she stayed
           G                D/F#             Em              D
I didn't think that she returned it we left New York in a whirl
     G                D/F#                  Em7	   
Time expands and then contracts when you are spinning in the grips of 
                                G
someone who is not an ordinary girl

          A                  D                G
When you sleep you find your mother in the night
        D                 G
But she stays just out of sight
         D         F#m               A
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
G              A                D               G
 And when you wake the morning covers you with light
        D               G
And it makes you feel alright
         D                  F#m             A           Dsus2 (to riff)
But it's just the same hard candy you're remembering again
D                 G           D/F#             Em               D
   You send your lover off to China then you wait for her to call 
(D)          G            D/F#               Em                D
You put your girl up on a pedestal then you wait for her to fall 
(D)         G               D/F#           Em                D
I put my summer's back in a letter and I hide it from the world 
(D)        G                  D/F#             Em7				
All the regrets you can't forget are somehow pressed upon a picture in
	        Em7                      G
 the face of such an ordinary girl 

          A                  D                G
When you sleep you find your mother in the night
        D                 G
But she stays just out of sight
         D         F#m               A
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
G              A                D               G
 And when you wake the morning covers you with light
        D               G
And it makes you feel alright
         D                  F#m             A           Dsus2 (to riff)
But it's just the same hard candy you're remembering again

      G      Em7    A
Again, again, again
     D                   G              A          D
It's just the same hard candy you're remembering again
      G      E    A
Again, again, again
         D                   G              A
And it's just the same hard candy you're remembering again

Outro: (with riff)
(D)           (D/C#)             (C)           (G)
   Go ask her    to come around   and see me late after dark
(D)            (D/C#)              (C)            (G)
   Don't ask me    to come around   then wait to see if there's a spark

(D)           (D/C#)            (C)           (G)
   Go ask her    to come around   and see me late after dark
(D)            (D/C#)            (C)            (G)
   Don't ask me    to come around   then wait to see if there's a spark
