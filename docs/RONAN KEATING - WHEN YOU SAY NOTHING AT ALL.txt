  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
G           D        C            D             G D C D
  Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
C                      D
Try as I may I can never explain
G        D            C             D
What I hear when you don't say a thing

G            D          Cadd9        D
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
        G            D          Cadd9      D
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
    G              D               Cadd9                 
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me 
             D C D   C              D                  G
where ever I fall. You say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
G             D        C        D             G D C D
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
C                      D
Try as I may I can never explain
G        D            C             D
