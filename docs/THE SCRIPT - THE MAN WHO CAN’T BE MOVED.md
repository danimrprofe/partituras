Capo 3
G  D/F#  C

       G                       D/F#				     
Going back to the corner where I first saw you, 
Am                               C
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move,
      G                       D/F#						
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand, 
     Am                               C
saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am.

 G                       D/F#				
Some try to hand me money they don't understand, 
     Am                               C
I'm not... broke I'm just a broken-hearted man,
            G                       D/F#		
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do, 
     Am                               C
how can I move on when I'm still in love with you...

           G                                  D			                
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
          Am                                   C	         
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be.
          G                                  D                                                         
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet.
          Am                      C                      D	
And you'd see me  waiting for you on the corner of the street.
             G     D	          Am   C
 So, I'm not moving... I'm not moving.
       G                       D/F#				     Am                               C
Policeman says, son you can't stay here, I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
G                       D/F#				       Am                               C
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows, If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
           G                                  D			                
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
          Am                                   C	         
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be.
          G                                  D                                                         
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet.
          Am                      C                      D	
And you'd see me  waiting for you on the corner of the street.
