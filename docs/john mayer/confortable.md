[Verse 4]

D                     Daug/A#
She says the Bible is all that she reads
Bm7                 Am7        D7  G
 And prefers that I not use profanity
G   A/G  Bm/G
Your mouth was
G/E  A/E   Bm/E
So    dir - ty

[Bridge]

G          A
Life of the party
        G                A
And she swears that she's artsy
    G           A
But you could distinguish
           Bm/G#
Miles from Coltrane

[Chorus]

  Our love was

  She's perfect
Bm7
  So flawless
Fmaj7 Am7     Bm7   E7   G   Em7b5
  Or   so they say - ay - ay - ay
Bm7   E7   G   Em7b5

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
    Bm7                     Am7          D7
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
G  A/G  Bm/G
I   loved you
G/E    A/E  Bm/E
  Grey  sweatpants

 No make  up
