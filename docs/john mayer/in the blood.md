[Verse 1]
(I recommend you continue using filler notes from intro^, but you don't have 
to)
 
G             Em            C             G
How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
G                          D                        (no filler notes for 
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
this bit)
G                  Em               C         G
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
 
[Verse 2]
G             Em          C          G
How much of my father am I destined to become?
G                                      D
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
       G             Em             C                G
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
 
[Chorus]
(no filler notes)
      Em              G          C              G
I can feel love the I want, I can feel the love I need
         Em          G             D
But it's never gonna calm the way I am
        Em             G            C             G
Could I change it if I wanted, can I rise above the flood?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
 
[Verse 3]
G               Em              C             G
How much like my brothers, do my brothers wanna be?
G                                D
Does a broken home become another broken family?
           G                Em          C          G
Or will we be there for each other, like nobody ever could?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
 
[Chorus]
      Em              G          C              G
I can feel love the I want, I can feel the love I need
         Em          G             D
But it's never gonna calm the way I am
        Em             G            C             G
Could I change it if I wanted, can I rise above the flood?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
(different strumming pattern)
      G                          C              G

         Em          G             D
But it's never gonna calm the way I am
        Em             G            C             G
Could I change it if I wanted, can I rise above the flood?
        Em              G              D            G
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
