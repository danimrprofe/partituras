SLOW DANCING IN A BURNING ROOM

ESTROFA
           C#m7
It's not a silly little moment
             Aadd9            E
It's not the storm before the calm
            C#m7
This is the deep and dying breath of
                          Aadd9   E
This love that we've been working on
 
              C#m7
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
         Aadd9          E
So I can feel you in my arms
         C#m7
Nobody's gonna come and save you
                      Aadd9   E
We've pulled too many false alarms
ESTRIBILLO

We're going down
            C#m7   Aadd9
And you can see it too
            Badd11
We're going down
        C#m7            F#m11
And you know that we're doomed
   C#m7                          Aadd9   E
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

ESTROFA
          C#m7
I was the one you always dreamed of
             Aadd9           E
You were the one I tried to draw
             C#m7
How dare you say it's nothing to me
                      Aadd9        E
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
 
              C#m7
I'll make the most of all the sadness
            Aadd9             E
You'll be a bitch because you can
           C#m7
You try to hit me just to hurt me so you leave me feeling dirty
           Aadd9      E
'Cause you can't understand
  
ESTRIBILLO
 
            Badd11
We're going down
            C#m7   Aadd9
And you can see it too
            Badd11
We're going down
        C#m7            F#m11
And you know that we're doomed
   C#m7                          Aadd9   E
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you
   F#m11             C#m7       Badd11  Aadd9
Go cry about it, why don't you
   F#m11             C#m7       Badd11  Aadd9
Go cry about it, why don't you

                          C#m7
Don't you think we oughta know by now
                             Aadd9         E
Don't you think we should've learned somehow
                          C#m7
Don't you think we oughta know by now
                             Aadd9         E
Don't you think we should've learned somehow
                          C#m7
Don't you think we oughta know by now
