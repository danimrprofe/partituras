FRENTE! 
BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE
ESTROFA
F              G			       Em                        Am
Every time I think of you, I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
F                                   G			   Em                       
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find Living a life that I 
        Am
can't leave behind
F                   G			    Em                     Am
There's no sense in telling me the wisdom of a fool won't set you free
              F				              G
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
      Em           Am
And every day my confusion grows
ESTRIBILLO 

F             G			  
Every time I see you falling,
Em                 Am
I get down on my knees and pray
  F                  G				      
I'm waiting for that FINAL moment 
Em                       Am
You'll say the words that I can't say
ESTROFA
F               G
I feel fine and I feel good
Em                  Am
I'm feeling like I never should
         F                            G
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
    Em                             Am
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
F                 G
I'm not sure what this could mean
Em                   Am
I don't think you're what you seem
     F
I do admit to myself
          G
That if I hurt someone else
          Em                    Am
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

F             G			  
Every time I see you falling,
Em                 Am
I get down on my knees and pray
  F                  G				      
I'm waiting for that FINAL moment 
Em                       Am
You'll say the words that I can't say
