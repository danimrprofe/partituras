  G     D/F# Em        Am            C
A long, long time ago, I can still remember
         Em                    D
How that music used to make me smile
    G     D/F#     Em
And I knew    if I had my chance
     Am                C
That I could make those people dance
    Em              C                D
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
Em             Am             Em                 Am
  But February made me shiver,  with every paper I'd deliver
C        G6/B    Am          Em                D
Bad news on  the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
  G          D/F#   Em              C                D
I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride
    G         D/F#           Em           C         D   G
But something touched me deep  inside the day the music died
ESTRIBILLO 
   G    C         G          D
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C             G          D
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G            C              G              D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                           A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
ESTROFA
G                 Am                  C                 Am
Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above
Em              D                 G    D/F#      Em
If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock and roll?
     Am               C
Can music save your mortal soul?
   Em                A7            D
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
        Em                  D
Well, I know that you're in love with him
Em            D          C          G          Am
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym You both kicked off your shoes
      C                  D            G      D/F# Em
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
      Am                  C          G      D/F#      Em
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck
      C      D      G
The day the music died
ESTRIBILLO 
                       G   C       G              D
I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove
   G            C             G          D
my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G            C              G              D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                        A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
ESTROFA
         G                    Am
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
        C             Am
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
   Em                  D
But  that's not how it used to be
         G          D/F#        Em
When the jester sang    for the king and queen
     Am                   C
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
      Em           A7               D
And a voice that came from you and me
       Em                   D
Oh, and  while the king was looking down
    Em              D
The jester stole his thorny crown
    C            G    Am
The courtroom was adjourned
 C               D
No verdict was returned
         G       D/F#       Em
And while Lennin read a book  on Marx
    Am               C
The quartet practiced in the park
    G       D/F#   Em
And we sang 'Dirges  In The Dark'
       C      D       G
The day the music died
ESTRIBILLO 
                    G    C       G              D
We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove
   G            C             G          D
my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G            C              G              D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                        A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
  
ESTROFA
G                 Am
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
         C                Am
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Em                    D
  Eight miles high and falling fast
G           D/F#     Em
Landed foul on the grass
    Am                  C
The players tried for a forward pass
         Em                A7          D
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
        Em               D
Now the half time air was sweet perfume
      Em                 D
While sergeants played a marching tune
   C       G       Am
We all got up to dance
         C                 D
Oh, but we never got the chance
           G            D/F#       Em
'Cause the players tried    to take  the field
       Am           C
The marching band refused to yield
G        D/F#         Em
Do you recall what was  revealed
       C      D        G
The day the music died?
 
ESTRIBILLO 
                       G    C       G              D
We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove
   G            C             G          D
my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G            C              G              D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                        A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 5]
       G                  Am
Oh, and there we were all in one place
 C           Am
A generation lost in space
     Em                    D
With no time left to start again
          G        D/F#    Em
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Am                  C
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
      Em            A7              D
'Cause  fire is the devil's only friend
       Em                 D
Oh, and  as I watched him on the stage
   Em                     D
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
C        G           Am
No angel born in hell
      C                       D
Could break that Satan's spell
                 G        D/F#   Em
And as the flames climbed high into the night
        Am         C
To light  the sacrificial rite
     G      D/F#     Em
I saw Satan laughing with delight
       C      D       G
The day the music died
 
ESTRIBILLO
                   G    C       G              D
He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove
   G            C             G          D
my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G       C              G               D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                        A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
 
 
G       D/F#     Em                Am                     C
I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news
     Em                  D          G       D/F#        Em
But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store
           Am              C                   Em                  C          
Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music 
           D
wouldn't play

    Em                 Am
And in the streets the children screamed
    Em                   Am
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
C          G6/B     Am
 But not a word was spoken
    C                        D
The church bells all were broken
        G         D/F#      Em
And the three men I   admire  most
    C                     D
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
G               D/F#       Em
They caught the last train for the coast
C           D     G
The day the music died
 
ESTRIBILLO 

                      G    C         G          D
And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C             G            D
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
     G            C              G              D
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        Em                        A7
Singing this'll be the day that I die
Em                        D7
This'll be the day that I die
                   G    C         G          D
They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Singing this'll be the day that I die
