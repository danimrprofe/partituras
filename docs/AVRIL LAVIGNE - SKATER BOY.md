ESTROFA
D5       A5              B5                
He was a boy; she was a girl 
              Bb5  
can I make it any more obvious
D5         A5                B5          
He was a punk, and she did ballet. 
      C5
What more can I say
D5         A5               B5      
He wanted her, she'd never tell. 
           Bb5
In secret she wanted him as well
D5                A5                     B5                
And all of their friends Stuck up their nose 
                C5                     F5
& they had a problem With his baggy clothes

          C5                         Bb5
He was a sk8er boy, she said see ya later boy, 
           A5             F5
he wasn't good enough for Her. 
         C5                             Bb5        
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space, 
             A5                  Bb5
she needed to come back down to earth
ESTROFA
D5                 A5                   
Five years from now. She sits at home 
            B5          Bb5
feeding the baby she's all alone
D5               A5
