    Am             Em      
Oh, life is bigger It's bigger than you 
            Am                             Em
And you are not me The lengths that I will go to
                     Am    Em                  Dm            G
The distance in your eyes Oh no, I've said too much I set it up

                  Am                     Em              
That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight 
            Am     Em
Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you
      Am                         Em                 Dm           
And I don't know if I can do it Oh no I've said too much 
                 G
I haven't said enough

                            F                  
I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that 
   G        Am      F                     G  Am
I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try

ESTROFA
G      Am              Em              Am              Em
Every whisper Of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions Trying to keep an eye on you
      Am    Em                  Dm      G
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool Oh no, I've said too much I set it up
      Am      Em
Consider this, consider this The hint of the century
      Am              Em
Consider this The slip that brought me To my knees failed
Am      Em      Dm      G
What if all these fantasies Come flailing around Now I've said too much
ESTRIBILLO
                            F                  
I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that 
   G        Am      F                     G  Am
I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try

That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight 
            Am     Em
Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you
