C/E F
C/G G5
G5 G3
 
[Verse 1]
   C            C/E
We had a kind of love
                Am       G/B  C
I thought that it would never end
       Dm          C            G
Oh my lover, oh my other, oh my friend
   Am                C/E
We talked around in circles and
   Am            G/B C
We talked around and then
  Dm               C             G
I loved you to the moon and back again
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F          Em   Am     G
You gave everything this golden glow
    F                C                    G
Now turn off all the stars, 'cause this I know
 
[Chorus]
        Am   G/B   C
That it hurts like so
C               F    G
To let somebody go
 
[Verse 2]
C                 C/E
All the storms we weathered
     Am        G/B      C
Everything that we went through
    Dm                   C             G
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?
       Am                C/E
When I called the mathematicians and
  Am          G/B C
I asked them to explain
          Dm           C            G
They said love is only equal to the pain
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F          Em  Am    G
And when everything was going wrong
F                 C            G
You could turn my sorrow into song
 
[Chorus]
      Am   G/B   C
Oh it hurts like so
C               F    G
To let somebody go
C               F    G
To let somebody go
 
[Bridge]
   Am G/B C C/E F C/G G5 G5 G3
Oh
   Am G/B C C/E
Oh 
F             C/G G5      G5   G3
(Let somebody,    let somebody go)
C                    C/B
Oh, when you love somebody
F
When you love somebody
G
Got to let somebody know
C                    C/B
Oh, when you love somebody
F
When you love somebody
G
Got to let somebody know
Am C                 C/B
So when you love somebody
F
When you love somebody
G        Em        Dm
Then it hurts like so
 
[Chorus]
   Am G/B C C/E F
To let somebody go
C/G G5 G5 G3
It hurts like so
   Am G/B C C/E F
To let somebody go
C/G G5            G5    G3
       But you're still with me now, I know
 
[Outro]
Am G/B C C/E F
            (Let somebody)
C/G G5        G5 G3
   (let somebody go)
G  Am G/B C
Oh
C/E F
   (Let somebody)
C/G G5        G5 G3
