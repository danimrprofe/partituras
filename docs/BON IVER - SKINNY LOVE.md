Am             F                   C
Come on skinny love, just last the year
Am            F                   C
Pour a little salt, we were never here
      Am         F                    C
My my my - my my my, my my my - my my my
               Dm                          Am
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

Am          F                C
I tell my love to wreck it all
Am              F                C
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
      Am         F                    C
My my my - my my my, my my my - my my my
             Dm                  Am
Right in the moment this order's tall
ESTRIBILLO
      C                             Em             Am
And I told you to be patient, and I told you to be fine
      C                              Em             Am
And I told you to be balanced, and I told you to be kind
       C
In the morning I'll be with you
            Em             Am
But it will be a different kind
        C
I'll be holding all the tickets
              Em             Am
And you'll be owning all the fines
ESTROFA
               F                   C
Come on skinny love, what happened here
Am            F                  C
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
      Am         F                    C
My my my - my my my, my my my - my my my
       Dm                           Am
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
 
ESTRIBILLO
      C                             Em             Am
And I told you to be patient, and I told you to be fine
      C                              Em             Am
And I told you to be balanced, and I told you to be kind
    C                             Em               Am
Now all your love is wasted, then who the hell was I?
              C
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
           Em              Am
And at the end of all your lines
 
PUENTE
C                    Em          Am
  Who will love you?    Who will fight?
C                   Em       Am
  And who will fall,   far behind?
               F           C
Come on skinny love ........
      Am         F                    C
My my my - my my my, my my my - my my my
      Am         F                    C
My my my - my my my, my my my - my my my
 
FINAL
Am  F  C
Am  F  C
