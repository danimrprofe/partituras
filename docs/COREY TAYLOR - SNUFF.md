Bury all your secrets in my skin. Come away with innocence,

So, if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.
                      G                                      Am
My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.

I still press your letters to my lips. And cherish them in parts of me
F          C          Am                       Em    F  C
that savour every kiss I couldn't face a life without your light.

So, save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                       G                                      Am
You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                          G                                   Am
I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                   G
I never claimed to be a Saint.
   F                                     Am
My own was banished long ago It took the Death of Hope to let you go
