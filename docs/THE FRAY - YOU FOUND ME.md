THE FRAY
YOU FOUND ME
CAPO 4
[Intro]
 
Em C  D  x2
 
(Start "I found God" at the end of C)
 
 
[Verse]
 
C              Em        D                    C
      I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
          Em        D       C
Where the west was all but won
Em         D                C
All alone, smoking his last cigarette
                 Em            D      C
I said where you been, he said ask anything         
 
           Em
Where were you?
     D              C
When everything was falling apart
       Em        D            C
All my days were spent by the telephone
         Em
It never rang
    D             C
And all I needed was a call
           Em
That never came
       D                   C
To the corner of First and Amistad
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         C      G             D
Lost and insecure You found me, you found me
Em       C         G           D
Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded
Em                C     G               D
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Em            C    G             D
Just a little late You found me, you found me
 
 
[Verse]
 
       Em  D                C
In the end everyone ends up alone
       Em   D                      C
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
      Em  D                  C
Who I am, who I'm not, who I want to be
          Em       D                C
No way to know how long she will be next to me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         C      G             D
Lost and insecure You found me, you found me
Em       C         G           D
Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded
Em                C     G               D
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Em            C    G             D
Just a little late You found me, you found me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
D         C                 D
For early morning, the city breaks
              C
But I've been calling for years and years and years and years
                               D
And you never left me no messages
                            C
You never send me no letters
                         D               C
You got some kind of nerve, taking all I want
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         C      G             D
Lost and insecure You found me, you found me
Em       C         G               D
Lying on the floor Where were you, Where were you
 
Em         C      G             D
Lost and insecure You found me, you found me
Em       C         G           D
Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded
Em                C     G               D
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Em            C    G             D
Just a little late You found me, you found me
 
 
[Outro]
 
Em                C     G          D
Why'd you have to wait? to find me to find me
