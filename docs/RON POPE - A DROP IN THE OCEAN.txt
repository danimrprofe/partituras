   Dm          Bb       F               C
A drop in the ocean A change in the weather      
      Dm               Bb           F         C
I was praying that you and me might end up together
          Dm          Bb        F                  C
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
        Dm              Bb      F           C         Bb      F
But I'm holding you closer than most 'cause you are my  heaven
 
C Dm Bb F C        Bb                  F
           I don't wanna waste the weekend
 
C                    Dm7
 If you don't love me   pretend
  Bb            F              C
A few more hours then it's time to go
      Bb                   F         C                     Dm7
As my train rolls down the east coast I wonder how you keep   warm
         Bb         F
It's too late to cry
              C
Too broken to move on
 
      Gm      F     C        Gm      F        C
And still I can't let you be Most nights I hardly sleep
Gm          F         C             Bb
Don't take what you don't need from me

C Dm Bb F C
 
Bb              F
Misplaced trust in old friends
C                  Dm7
 Never counting on regrets
       Bb          F               C
By the grace of God I do not a rest at all
        Bb                   F
And New England as the leaves change
C                Dm7
 The last excuse that I'll claim
        Bb           F               C
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl
  
       Gm          F   C
Still I  can't let you be
Gm           F C
  Most nights I hardly sleep
Gm          F         C         Bb
  Don't take what you don't need  from me

Gm             F         C
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
No, no
Gm             F        C
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Gm             F         C
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
