uning:
E A D G B E
Capo:
1st fret
Love the Goo Goo Dolls, got tired of having to re-tune,
so I finally sat down and came up with a way to play it
in standard tuning without losing any richness.
Easy, fun, always a favorite.

[Verse 1]
C                              F
Baby's black balloon makes her fly
C                       F
I almost fell into that hole in your life
C                              F
And you're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
      Am             G/B     C
Cause you were there same as me
    F  C/E   G          F
But on your kneeeeeeeees

[Verse 2]
C                              F
1,000 other boys could never reach you
C                         F
How could I have been the one
C                         F
I saw the world spinnin' beneath you
     Am          G/B            C
And scatter like ice from the spoon that
 F   C/E   G      F
Was your wooooooooomb
 
[Chorus]
Am     G       F            C
Comin down the world turned over
    Am     G        F       C
And angels fall without you there
    Am   G      F       C
And I go on as you get colder
    F        G         C
Or are you someone's prayer
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
C                             F
You know the lies they always told you
C                      F
And the love you never knew
C                            F
What's the things they never showed you
       Am           G/B            C
That swallowed the light from the sun
   F  C/E    G            F
Inside your rooooom, yeeahaaa
 
[Chorus]
Am7     G      Fadd9            C
Comin down the world turned over
    Am7     G        F9       C
And angels fall without you there
    Am7    G     F9       C
And I go on as you get colder
F        G
Always someone

C/E                 F                G
       And there's no time left for losin'
          G
When you stand they'll fall
 
[Chorus]
Am7      G        F            C
Comin' down the world turned over

Comin' down the years turn over
    Am7     G      F9       C
And angels fall without you there
    Am7   G         F9        C
And I go on now to lead you home and
F     G
All because I'm
C/E
All because I'm
Dm7
I'll become
      F             C
What you became to me
