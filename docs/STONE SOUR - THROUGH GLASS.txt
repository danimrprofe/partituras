I'm looking at you through the glass 
                      D      
Don't know how much time has passed 
			Em			C
All know is that it feels like forever 

When no one ever tells you that
D                           Em
forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your head [x2]

           C                     D					         
How do you feel? That is the question 
         Em
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
     C                              D			                   
When something like a soul becomes initialized 
                    Em
and folded up like paper dolls and little notes 

You can't expect a bit of hope
      C				        D		               
And while you're outside looking in describing what you see, 
Em
remember what you're staring at is me

                      D      
Don't know how much time has passed

            C                    D		   
How much is real? So much to question. 
      Em
An epidemic of the mannequins 

Contaminating everything
     C					     D                             
When thought came from the heart It never did right from the start 
      Em
Just listen to the noises (No more sad voices)
C                             D	       			 
Before you tell yourself It's just a different scene 
Em
remember it's just different from what you've seen
