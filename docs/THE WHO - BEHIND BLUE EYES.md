THE WHO 
BEHIND BLUE EYES
The who
ESTROFA
Em                     G               D       Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
          Cadd9      Asus2
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D      Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like to be hated
      Cadd9            Asus2
To be fated to telling only lies
ESTRIBILLO
       C  D                 G Gsus4 G	       C          D     E Esus4 E
But my dreams, they aren't as empty. As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C			           D   Dsus4 D        Asus2
I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance that's never free
Em                      G                   D  Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
       Cadd9           Asus2
Like I do, and I blame you
ESTROFA
Em                    G             D Dsus4 D
No one bites back as hard on their anger
           Cadd9                 Asus2
None of my pain and woe can show through
ESTRIBILLO
       C  D                 G Gsus4 G	       C          D     E Esus4 E
But my dreams, they aren't as empty. As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C			           D   Dsus4 D        Asus2
I have hours, only lonely. My love is vengeance that's never free
| E | Bm A | E | Bm A |
E             Bm       A         E            Bm         G       D
 When my fist clenches crack it open before I use it and lose my cool
       Bm     A           D                 Bm        A          E   Bm  A
When I smile tell me some bad news before I laugh and act like a fool
E         Bm      A        E             Bm     G       D
 And if I swallow anything evil put your finger down my throat
         Bm            A         D               Bm          A         E  Bm  A     E  Bm  A
And if I shiver please give me a blanket keep me warm let me wear your coat
| B | A G D | B | A G D | B | A G D | B | B/A |
Em                     G              D        Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
          Cadd9      A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
