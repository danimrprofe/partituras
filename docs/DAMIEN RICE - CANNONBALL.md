There's still a little bit of your taste, in my mouth. 
Em7                   Cadd9         G             G/F#
There's still a little bit of you laced, with my doubt
Em7                Cadd9     G   G/F#         Am7 C/B  C  D
It's still a little hard to say, what's going on
Em7                     Cadd9        G          G/F#
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Em7                    Cadd9         G      G/F#     Em7
There's still a little bit of your face, I haven't kissed
                  Cadd9        G       G/F#      Am7    C/B  C  D
You step a little closer each day, that I can't say what's going on

Stones taught me to fly. Love taught me to lie. Life taught me to die
             Am7                   Cadd9        D
So it's not hard to fall, when you float like a cannonball

ESTROFA
Em7                   Cadd9         G       G/F#		
There's still a little bit of your song, in my ear. 
Em7                   Cadd9         G       G/F#
There's still a little bit of your words, I long to hear
Em7               Cadd9     G      G/F#               Am7    C/B  C  D
You step a little closer to me, so close that I can't see what's going on
ESTRIBILLO
G      Cadd9/G      D     G   Cadd9/G       D  
Stones taught me to fly. Love taught me to cry. 
     G              Cadd9/G        D
So come on courage teach me to be shy
                Am7              Cadd9           D
Cause it's not hard to fall, and I don't wanna scare her
          Am7                Cadd9        D
It's not hard to fall, and I don't wanna lose
          Am7                   Cadd9          D              Em7
It's not hard to grow, when you know that you just don't know
Em7  Cadd9  G   G/F#
