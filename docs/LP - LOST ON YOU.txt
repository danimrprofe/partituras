             Am
When you get older, plainer, saner
            D6                             Em
Will you remember all the danger we came from
             Am
Burning like embers, falling, tender
                 D6
Longing for the days of no surrender
       Em
Years ago And well you know 

  Am                                    D6
Smoke them if you got them 'Cause it's going down
Em
All I ever wanted was you
      Am                                 D6
I'll never get to heaven 'Cause I don't know how
       Em
Let's raise a glass or two

   C         G/B     Am            D6
To all the things I lost on you Oh oh
                  Em              C
Tell me are they lost on you? Oh oh
           G/B       Am             D6
Just that you could cut me loose Oh oh
                       Em
After everything I've lost on you
         C
Is that lost on you?

ESTROFA
                 Am
Wishing I could see the machinations
                D6                           Em
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
                  Am
Hold me like you never lost your patience
                  D                                 Em
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time

And you're still mine

  Am                                    D6
Smoke them if you got them 'Cause it's going down
Em
All I ever wanted was you
      Am                                 D6
