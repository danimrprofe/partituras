  C      D      Am      C      D       Am
I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel
  C     D      Am        C    D            Am7
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
    C      D       Am7       C     D      Am7
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
       C       D    Am7          C      D    G
Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything
ESTRIBILLO
Am7           Fadd9 C*           G
What Have I become,  my sweetest friend
Am7        Fadd9       C*         G
Everyone I know, goes away in the end
    Am7               Fadd9  C             G
And you could have it all,  my empire of dirt
Am7             Fadd9 G               | Am | C D | Am | C D | Am |
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt
ESTROFA
  C         D        Am       C      D      Am
I wear this crown of thorns, upon my liar's chair
C       D      Am        C    D     Am
Full of broken thoughts, I cannot repair
  C         D         Am        C       D      Am
Beneath the stains of time, the feeling   disappears
C       D       Am    C    D           G
You are someone else, I am still right here
ESTRIBILLO
Am7           Fadd9 C*            G
What Have I become,  my sweetest friend
Am7        Fadd9       C*         G
Everyone I know, goes away in the end
    Am7               Fadd9 G
And you could have it all,  my empire of dirt
Am7            Fadd9 G
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

   Am7            Fadd9   G
If I could start again, a million miles away
Am7            Fadd9  G
I would keep myself,  I would find a way
                    (single strum)
