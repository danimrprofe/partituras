[Verse 1]
          Am
Ooh I'm a mess right now
       G
Inside out
                C
Searching for a sweet surrender
    F               C
But this is not the end
        Am
I can't work it out
  G
How?
                  C
Going through the motions
F               G
Going through us

[Pre-Hook]
    F                                C
And oh I've known it for the longest time
              G            F
And all of my hopes all my words
                            C
Are all over written on the signs
                 G               F
But you're on my road walking me home
Home, home

[Hook]
Am                         G
  See the flames inside my eyes
            F                        C        Am
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
                      G
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
          F                     C
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
             Dm          F
And put your faith in my-y stomach

[Verse 2]
         Am
I messed up this time
          G
Late last night
            C
Drinking to suppress devotion
     F            C
With fingers intertwined
        Am
I can't shake this feeling
   G
No-ow
                        C
We're going through the motions
F            G
Hopin' you'd stop

[Pre-Hook 2]
    F
And oh I've only caused you pain
  C                  G
I know but all of my words
              F
Will always below
                        C
Although all the lie we spoke
                  G               F
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home

[Hook]
Am                         G
  See the flames inside my eyes
            F                        C        Am
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
                      G
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
          F                     C
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
             Dm          F
And put your faith in my-y stomach
