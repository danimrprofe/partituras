# Be like that

```
[1st verse]
G                            D
He spends his nights in California,
Em                             C
Watching the stars on the big screen
G                          D
Then he lies awake and he wonders,
Em                C
Why can't that be me?
G
Cause in his life he's filled
     D
With all these good intentions
Em
He's left a lot of things
       C                       G
He'd rather not mention right now
                          D
But just before he says goodnight,
Em                   C
He looks up with a little smile at me,

And he says...

[chorus]
G                   D
If I could be like that,

I would give anything
Em                 C
Just to live one day, in those shoes
G                   D
If I could be like that,
             Em
What would I do,
              C
What would I do?

[2nd verse]
G                                D
She spends her days up in the north park,
Em                            C
Watching the people as they pass
G
And all she wants is just
    D
A little piece of this dream,
Em                   C
Is that too much to ask?
        G                D
With a safe home, and a warm bed,
Em                   C
On a quiet little street
G                            D
All she wants is just that something to
            Em             C
Hold onto, that's all she needs

Yeah!

[chorus] x3
G                   D
If I could be like that,

I would give anything
Em                 C
Just to live one day, in those shoes
G                   D
If I could be like that,
             Em
What would I do,
              C
What would I do?
