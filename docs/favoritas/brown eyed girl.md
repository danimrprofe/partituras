G          C      G                D
 Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G                C             G            D
 Going down the old mine with a transistor radio
G                C                 G                  D
 Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind the rainbow's wall
G               C      G              D
 Slipping and a-sliding all along the waterfall
     C   D              G      Em
With you, my brown eyed girl
C       D           G
 You, my brown eyed girl
D
 Do you remember when we used to sing
G          C           G              D
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da. Just like that
G          C           G              D         G
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da. La-te-da.

G            C         G                  D
 So hard to find my way now that I'm all on my own
G                    C        G        D
 I saw you just the other day, my, how you have grown
G                C               G                D
 Cast my memory back there, Lord. Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about it
G                   C          G           D
 Making love in the green grass behind the stadium
     C   D              G      Em
With you, my brown eyed girl
C       D           G
 You, my brown eyed girl
D
 Do you remember when we used to sing
G          C           G              D
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da
G          C           G              D
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da
