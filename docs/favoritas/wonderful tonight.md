D     2-x-0-0-0-3

[Verse 1]
G                D        C                           D
It’s late in the evening, she’s wond’rin what clothes to wear.
G               D        C                     D
She puts on her make-up, and brushes her long, blonde hair.
C            D        G     D     Em
And then she asks me, “Do I look alright?”
           C             D           G       D   C   D
And I say “Yes, you look wonderful tonight.”

[Verse 2]
G          D      C                  D
We go to a party, and everyone turns to see
G              D     C                    D
This beautiful lady, who’s walking around with me
C            D        G       D      Em
And then she asks me, “Do you feel alright?”
            C           D           G       D   C   D
And I say, “Yes, I feel wonderful tonight.”

[Bridge]
       C           D               G                  Em
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
        C            D               C             D
And the wonder of it all is that you just don’t realise
           G         D   C   D
How much I love you.

[Verse 3]
G                    D    C               D
It’s time to go home now, and I’ve got an achin’ head
G                     D    C                   D
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
C          D        G     D            Em
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
        C                    D           G   D/F#  Em
I say, “My darling, you were wonderful tonight.”

        C                    D            G
Oh, “My darling, you were wonderful to-night.”
