 Time is never time at all
                     Fig. 1                 Fig. 2
 You can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth.
 Fig. 1                      Fig. 1
 And our lives are forever changed,
                     Fig. 1                          Fig. 2
 We will never be the same; The more you change the less you feel.

 Fig. 1    Fig.1         Fig.1       G  D/F#    Em
 Believe, believe in me, believe (believe)
       Am                     C                    G   D/F#   Em

       Am                    C        Cadd9 G/B  D     Cadd9 G/B  D
 We're not the same, we're different toniiiiiiiiiiiIIIight.

**Estrofa**

 G
 And you know you're never sure
                              Em
 But you're sure you could be right

 If you held yourself up to the light
 G                                               Em
 And the embers never fade in your city by the lake

 The place where you were born.

Fig. 1    Fig.1         Fig.1       G  D/F#    Em
 Believe, believe in me, believe (believe)
        Am          C        G  D/F#  Em
 In the resolute urgency of now
         Am                  C           Cadd9  G/B   D     Cadd9  G/B  D
 And if you believe there's not a chance toniiiiiiiiiiiIIIight.

 Toniiiiiiight, tonight, so bright
 Cadd9   G/B  D     G   D/F#   Em
 Toniiiiiiight,   tonight

 We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight (tonight)
        Am           C             G    D/F# Em
 We'll find a way to offer up the night (tonight)
         Am           C              G  D/F#   Em
 The indescribable moments of your life (tonight)
