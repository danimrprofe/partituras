# Through the glass


```
                           C
I'm looking at you through the glass


**Estribillo**
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                Em
Oh God, it feels   like forever
                                  C
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
D                           Em
Sitting all alone inside your   head
                                  C
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head


[Verse 1]
           C                     D
How do you feel? That is the question
         Em
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
     C                              D
When something like a soul becomes initialized
                   Em
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope
C
And while you're outside looking in
D
Describing what you see
  Em
Remember what you're staring at is me
                                 C
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass


**Estribillo**
                        D                                Em
Don't know how much time  has passed AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head


[Verse 2]
            C                    D
How much is real? So much to question
      Em
An epidemic of the mannequins Contaminating everything
     C
When thought came from the heart
   D                             Em
It never did right from the start Just listen to the noises
No more sad voices
C                             D
Before you tell yourself It's just a different scene
  Em
Remember it's just different from what you've seen


**Estribillo**
                           C                                 D
I'm looking at you through the glass Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
                                  C
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
             C
And it's the stars

[Interlude]
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                      Em
All I know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
