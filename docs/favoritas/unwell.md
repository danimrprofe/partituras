G                                  C
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
Em7                                         D
   But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
G                                  C
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
Em7                                        D
   But soon enough you're gonna think of me
                    G
And how I used to be

 I'm just a little unwell
