**Intro**
G  D/F#  C

**Estrofa**
       G                       D/F#
Going back to the corner where I first saw you,
     Am                               C
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move,
      G                       D/F#
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand,
     Am                               C
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am,
           G                       D/F#
Some try to hand me money they don't understand,
            Am                               C
I'm not... broke I'm just a broken hearted man,
            G                       D/F#
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do,
     Am                               C
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you...

[Pre-Chorus]
           G                                 D
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
           Am                                   C
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
         G                                 D
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
           Am                             C             D
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.

**Estribillo**
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.

**Estrofa**
G                        D/F#
Policeman says, son you can't stay here,
                 Am                      C
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
G                       D/F#
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,
    Am                               C
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.

[Pre-Chorus]
           G                                 D
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
           Am                                   C
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
         G                                 D
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
           Am                             C             D
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.

**Estribillo**
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.

[Interlude]
Em                   Am
People talk about the guy
       C
Who's waiting on a girl...

Oohoohwoo
Em                         Am
There are no holes in his shoes
          C
But a big hole in his world...

Hmmmm

[Bridge]
Em                 D
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved,
        Am                        C              D
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,
Em                              D
And you'll come running to the corner...
Am
'Cause you'll know it's just for you

I'm the man who can't be moved
          C
I'm the man who can't be moved...

[Pre-Chorus]
           G                                 D
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
           Am                                   C
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
         G                                 D
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
           Am                             C             D
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.

**Estribillo**
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.
        G        D
So I'm not moving...
        Am       C
I'm not moving.

[Outro]
      G                          D/F#
Going back to the corner where I first saw you,
       Am                             C
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move.
