[Intro]

Am  D6  Em
Am  D6  Em

[Primeira Parte]

             Am
When you get older, plainer, saner
            D6                             Em
Will you remember all the danger we came from
             Am
Burning like embers, falling, tender
                 D6
Longing for the days of no surrender
       Em
Years ago

And well you know

[Pré-Refrão]

  Am
Smoke them if you got them
             D6
'Cause it's going down
Em
All I ever wanted was you
      Am
I'll never get to heaven
          D6
'Cause I don't know how
       Em
Let's raise a glass or two

[Chorus]

   C         G/B     Am
To all the things I lost on you
   D6
Oh oh
                  Em
Tell me are they lost on you?
   C
Oh oh
           G/B       Am
Just that you could cut me loose
   D6
Oh oh
                       Em
After everything I've lost on you
         C
Is that lost on you?
      G/B   Am   D6
Oh oh oh oh oh oooh
    Em
Oooooh
         C
Is that lost on you?
      G/B   Am   D6
Oh oh oh oh oh oooh
              Em
Baby is that lost on you?
        C
Is that lost on you?

[Segunda Parte]

                 Am
Wishing I could see the machinations
                D6                           Em
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
                  Am
Hold me like you never lost your patience
                  D                                 Em
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time

And you're still mine

[Pré-Refrão]

     Am
So smoke 'em if you've got 'em
             D6
'Cause it's going down
Em
All I ever wanted was you
       Am
Let's take a drink of ever lisk
     D6
And turn around
       Em
Let's raise a glass or two

[Refrão]

   C         G/B     Am
To all the things I lost on you
   D6
Oh oh
                  Em
Tell me are they lost on you?
   C
Oh oh
           G/B       Am
Just that you could cut me loose
   D6
Oh oh
                       Em
After everything I've lost on you
         C
Is that lost on you?
      G/B   Am   D6
Oh oh oh oh oh oooh
    Em
Oooooh
         C
Is that lost on you?
      G/B   Am   D6
Oh oh oh oh oh oooh
              Em

Is that lost on you?

 Am         D6

 Em         C  Am  D6
Lost on you
       Em                C
Let's raise a glass or two

Is that lost on you?
     D6  Em     C
Oooh ooh oooooh oooh
Am   D6  Em     C
Oooh ooh oooooh oooh
