[Intro]
G   D   Em  C

[Verse 1]
G                          D                              Em     C
  I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
G                            D                        Em     C
  This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
                     G                 D                Em                C
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know, somebody to have, somebody to hold
              G                      D
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Em                                C
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
                G             D
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Em                         C
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  G                          D
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Em                         C
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
G                            D                               Em     C
   I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
G                            D                           Em     C
  This all or nothing way of lovin' got me sleepin' without you
                         G                 D                Em                         C
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal, somebody to have, just to know how it feels
              G                      D
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Em                             C
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

[Chorus]
               G                D
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Em                        C
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  G                          D
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Em                         C
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
    Am           Em                  D
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
                 Am7
I fall into your arms
         Em7                         D
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

[Chorus]
N.C.                 G                D
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Em                        C
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  G                          D
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Em                         C
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

                    G                D
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Em                        C
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  G                          D
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Em                         C
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Outro]
                  G                            D
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Em                         C     G
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
