[Verse 1]
         G              D/F#           C               Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
             G                  Em                Am       Am7     D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know
       G            D/F#         C                Am7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want to, you can marry
        G        Em           Am   Am Am7 D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
      G                 D          C                  Am7
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
      G                Em                    Am Am Am7 D
To be calm when you've found something going on
              G             D                 C                 Am7
But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
             G                 Em             D          G   C/G
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

[Verse 2]
        G          Bm                   C            Am7
How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
     G               Em             Am7   D
It's always been the same, same old story
         G              Bm         C          Am7
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
              G          Em          D       G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
  D      C       G  C/G
I know I have to go

[Verse 3]
         G              D                C                Am7
It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly
       (Away,          away,             away
             G                  Em                Am                  D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through
                 (I                 know          I    have    to     make ...)
             G            D            C             Am7
      Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
( ... this decision                   alone ...)

        G        Em           Am    Am Am7 D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
         (No ...)

[Verse 4]
        G               Bm             C                Am7
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
       (Stay,           stay,          stay
     G              Em         Am       Am Am7 D
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
        (Why          must       you go    and make ...)
             G           Bm             C                   Am7
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
( ... this decision                    alone ...)
              G          Em          D       G       G/D
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
  D      C       G
I know I have to go
