Love of mine, someday you will die, but I'll be close behind

   C/G                          Am/E                           F
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white, just our hands clasped so tight
        C                 G
Waiting for the hint of a spark

   Am                C              F             C   C/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
     Am            C             G
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
   Am               C                  E      Am   G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

Then I'll follow you into the dark

   C/G                            Am/E                 F
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule, I got my knuckles bruised
     C       G
by a lady in black
      C/G                   Am/E                       F
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son, fear is the heart of love"
     C          G
So I never went back

   Am                C              F             C   C/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
     Am            C             G
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
   Am               C                  E      Am   G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

You and me have seen everything to see from Bangkok to Calgary
        C             G
And the soles of your shoes
    C/G                         Am/E                          F
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now, it's nothing to cry about
            C               G
Cause we'll hold each other soon
    Am          F
The blackest of rooms

       Am                C              F             C   C/B
And if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
     Am            C             G
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
   Am               C                  E      Am   G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
     F           Fm           C  C/B  Am
Then I'll follow you into the dark
