[Verse 1]

C          G                Am            F                 C
  So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
             G                Am            F                C
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
      G                Am       F            C
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        G                   Am             F
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]

C           G            Am            F              C
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F              C
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]

(C)      G             Am        F                 C
And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
           G            Am           F                C
To want you to guide you through the darkest of your days
      G                Am       F            C
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        G                    Am               F
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you

[Chorus]

C           G            Am            F              C
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F             Am
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

[Bridge]

(Am)   F                G
       Run away with my heart
Em               Am
Run away with my hope
F                 G        Em
Run away with my love

[Verse 3] (Play intro until second F)

C           G
  I know now just quite how
Am            F                    C
  My life and love might still go on
             G
In your heart, in your mind
Am                F              C
  I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]

(C)       G            Am            F              C
If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F              C
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

           G          Am               F              C
If I could turn back time, I'll go wherever you will go
           G         Am               F              C
If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will goooooooo

G      Am              F              C       G      Am    F
ooooo      I'll go wherever you will goooooooooooooo
