**Intro**

Bm    G  A


[Verse 1]

          Bm
A hundred days have made me older
          A                                      Bm  G  A
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
           Bm
A thousand lies have made me colder
      A                                        Bm  G  A
And I don't think I can look at this the same
Bm                          A
But all the miles that seperate
Bm                           G                A
They dissapear now, when I'm dreaming of your face


**Estribillo**

D                              A
I'm here without you, baby
                                    Bm
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         G           A                       D
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
                            A
I'm here without you, baby
                               Bm
But you're still with me in my dreams
        G    A                    Bm   A    Bm  G  A
And tonight, there's only you and me, yeah


[Verse 2]

    Bm
The miles just keep rollin'
       A                                    Bm  G  A
As the people leave their way to say hello
                Bm
I've heard this life is overrated
      A                              Bm      G    A
But I hope that it gets better as we go, ohh yeah yeah


**Estribillo**

D                              A
I'm here without you, baby
                                    Bm
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         G           A                       D
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
                            A
I'm here without you, baby
                               Bm
But you're still with me in my dreams
       G          A                    Bm
And tonight girl, there's only you and me


[Bridge]

Bm                 D
Everything I know, and anywhere I go
A                         G
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
Bm                           D
And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
A                           G            G
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa

But you're still on my lonely mind
