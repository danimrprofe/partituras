Am            D       Fmaj7                G
 Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Am               D                Fmaj7               G
 Will it make it easier on you now you got someone to blame?

         C         Am        Fmaj7              C
You say, "One love, one life, when it's one need in the night."
         Am                  Fmaj7                     C
One love, we get to share it, it leaves you baby if you don't care for it

Am         D         Fmaj7                        G
 Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                      D       Fmaj7                      G
 You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.

          C         Am      Fmaj7                C
Well, it's too late, tonight to drag the past out into the light
                    Am                      Fmaj7                C
We're one, but we're not the same, we get to carry each other, carry each other. One

Am                        D         Fmaj7               G
 Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                         D     Fmaj7                 G
 Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?

C                  Am               Fmaj7                         C
 Did I ask to much, more than a lot? You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
                    Am                     Fmaj7                     C
We're one, but we're not the same. Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

        C                  Am
You say, "Love is a temple, love a higher law."
C                 Am
"Love is a temple, love the higher law."
    C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
                        Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt

C         Am        Fmaj7                  C
 One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should
C        Am               Fmaj7    C
 One life with each other. Sisters, brothers
C                   Am                      Fmaj7                 C
 One life, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other. One
C  Am  Fmaj7  C
     One
