         C                         Em                       Fmaj7
He said "Son, have you seen the world? Well, what would you say
                    C                    Fmaj7                      C
if I said that you could? Just carry this gun and you'll even get paid"
C                           G
 I said "That sounds pretty good"
              C                      Em
Black leather boots, spitshined so  bright
                    Fsus2               C
They cut off my hair     but it looks alright

We marched and we sang
Fsus2
     We all became friends
C                     G
 As we learned how to fight

           Am                       Fmaj7                   C
A hero of war, Yeah that's what I'll be, and when I come home
                          G                   Am                    Fmaj7
They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag, to the grave if I must
                          C                          G
'cause it's a flag that I love, and a flag that I trust

[Verse 3]
I kicked in the door
C
 I yelled my commands
Em
   The children, they cried
Fsus2            C
     But I got my man
We took him away
Fsus2
     A bag over his face
C                        G
 From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes


[Verse 4]
C                   Em                    Fmaj7                   C
 They pissed in his hands, I told them to stop, but then I joined in
                 Fmaj7                       C                   G
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once, but again and again

    Csus2                      Em
She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
Fadd11                C
      I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
Fadd11               C
      So I lifted my gun
             G
And I fired away


[Verse 6]
              C
And the shells jumped through the smoke
Em
   And into the sand
Fsus2                       C
     That the blood now had soaked
             Fsus2                   C
She collapsed     with a flag in her hand
                G
A flag white as snow
A hero of war

           Am                    Fmaj7                   C
A hero of war, Is that what they see , Just medals and scars
                   G                          Am                    Fmaj7
 So damn proud of me. And I brought home that flag, Now it gathers dust
                        C                          G
But it's a flag that I love, It's the only flag I trust

         Am                        Em                       Fmaj7
He said, "Son, have you seen the world? Well what would you say,
                    C
if I said that you could?"
