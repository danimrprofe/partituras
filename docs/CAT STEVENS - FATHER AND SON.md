CAT STEVENS 
FATHER AND SON
           G             D/F#           C               Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
             G                  Em                Am       Am7     D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know
       G            D/F#         C                Am7			        
Find a girl, settle down, if you want to, you can marry. 
        G        Em           Am Am7 D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
      G                 D          C                  Am7	     
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy 
        G               Em              Am Am7 D
to be calm when you've found something going on
              G             D                 C                 Am7
But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
             G                 Em             D          G   C/G
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not
        G             Bm                C             Am7
How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
     G               Em             Am7   D
It's always been the same, same old story
         G              Bm         C          Am7			                        
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen. 
               G          Em           D     G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go 
         D      C       G
away, I know I have to go

G    D    C    Am7 G    Em   Am7  D
G    D    C    Am7 G    Em   D    G
D    C    G
         G              D                C                Am7
It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly
             G                  Em                Am               D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go 
                 G            D            C             Am7
Through. Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
        G        Em           Am    Am Am7 D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
        G               Bm             C                 Am7
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things, I knew inside
     G              Em         Am       Am Am7 D
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
             G           Bm             C                   Am7
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
G          Em          D       G       G/D			D      C       G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away. I know I have to go
