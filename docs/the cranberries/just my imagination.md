[Intro]
G    D    Am    Em  D
 
[Verse]
G                           D
There was a game we used to play
         Am
We would hit the town on Friday night
    Em          D
And stay in bed until Sunday
G                D
We used to be so free
        Am
We were living for the love we had and
Em               D
Living not for reality
 
[Chorus]
        G
It was just my imagination
        D
It was just my imagination
        Am
It was just my imagination
Em  D
It was
 
G
just my imagination
        D
It was just my imagination
        Am
It was just my immagination
Em  D
It was
 
G    D    Am    Em  D
 
[Verse]
G                          D
There was a time I used to pray
       Am
I have always kept my faith in love
         Em                      D
It's the greatest thing from the man above
G                  D
The game I used to play
            Am
I've always put my cards upon the table
       Em                     D
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable
 
[Chorus]
        G
It was just my imagination
        D
It was just my imagination
        Am
It was just my imagination
Em  D
It was
 
G
just my imagination
        D
It was just my imagination
        Am
It was just my imagination
Em  D
It was
 
[Verse]
G                         D
There is a game I like to play
          Am
I like to hit the town on Friday night
    Em          D
And stay in bed until Sunday
G                    D
We'll always be this free
           Am
We will be living for the love we have
Em               D
Living not for reality
 
[Chorus]
      G
It's not my imagination
      D
It's not my imagination
      Am
It's not my imagination
Em  D
It was
 
 G
Not my imagination
      D
It's not my imagination
      Am
It's not my imagination
Em  D
It was
 
Not my x18
