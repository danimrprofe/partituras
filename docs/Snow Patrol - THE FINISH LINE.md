Snow Patrol
THE FINISH LINE
C          Am       G              F
     The earth is warm next to my ear
C        Am    G                  F
     Insects noise is all that I hear
C          Am          G              F
     A magic trick makes the world disappear
C          Am       G                               F
     The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear
 
G                         Am              F
A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
G                              Am            F
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
G                                 Am             F
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
G                           Am             F
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch
 
C          Am       G              F
      Cold water, cleaning my wounds
C          Am       G              F
      A side parade, with a single balloon
C          Am       G              F
      I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
C          Am       G              F
      Blue as seas, running to them
 
G                         Am              F
I feel like I am watching everything from space
G                       Am            F
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
G                            Am                   F
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
G                            Am                  F
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
