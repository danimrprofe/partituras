VERSE:
 
C       F          C
  Crazy guy with a matted beard

Shouting out "end times are near"
And nobody noticed him

 C      F          C
Crazy guy with a matted beard
  F              C
Standing on the corner
  C       F        C
Shouting out "end times are near"
     F      C
And nobody noticed him
 
    A#     F                  C   F  C
But I can hear him loud and clear
A#      Dm      Am            A#
She is gone now, and nowhere near
A#          F             C   F  C
Seems like end times are here
 
C         F      C
I walk around a puddle in the street
     F       C
And head on home
C           F                C
Outside my window there's a cat in heat
C                  F         C
Shut up, cat, and leave me alone
 
       A#       F             C   F  C
There ain't no heat on round here
A#           Dm          Am         A#
I don't feel nothing now; not even fear
A#       F              C   F  C
Now that end times are here
 
    C            F             C
Now everyone's crazy, they've lost their minds
      F           C
Just look at the world
         C      F       C            C  F  C
It could all be over at any old time
 
    A#     F                 C   F  C
And I can hear it loud and clear
A#           Dm     Am              A#
The world is ending, and what do I care?
A#         F               C   F  C
She's gone, end times are here
