ESTROFA
           Bm				                  
A hundred days have made me older. 
           A                                Bm  G  A
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face

A thousand lies have made me colder. 
       A                                  Bm  G  A
And I don't think I can look at this the same

Bm                          A	
But all the miles that separate. 
Bm                             G               A
They disappear now, when I'm dreaming of your face

The miles just keep rollin'.
         A                              Bm  G  A
As the people leave their way to say hello
                Bm				      
I've heard this life is overrated, 
       A                             Bm      G    A

Everything I know, and anywhere I go 
A                         G
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
Bm                           D			
And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
A                          G
