STANDARD TUNING with open d ( E A D G B d )
CAPO ON 1ST FRET
 
 
CHORDS :   Em - 022030   D   - xx0230   C9 - x32030
           G  - 320030   G/B - x20030
 
*** We all know The Goo Goo Dolls used a weird alternate tuning of D# A# D# G# G#
d# for this song--something which is tedious to do & very time-consuming. You
might also break a couple of strings in the process.  In short, it's a headache to
play!  So I came up with this tab to make our lives a whole lot easier. Just drop
the 1st (e) string to D and you're good to go.
 
If you love the song so much but too lazy to dabble with the machine heads then I
guess you should opt for my version.
