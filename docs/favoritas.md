# Behind blue eyes
```
Em                     G               D       Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
          Cadd9      Asus2
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D      Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like to be hated
      Cadd9            Asus2
To be fated to telling only lies

       C  D                   G     Gsus4 G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
      C          D         E  Esus4 E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D   Dsus4 D            Asus2
My love is vengeance that's never free

Em                     G                  D       Dsus4 D
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
       Cadd9           Asus2
Like I do, and I blame you
Em                    G            D      Dsus4 D
No one bites back as hard on their anger
           Cadd9                 Asus2
None of my pain and woe can show through

       C  D                   G     Gsus4 G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
      C          D         E  Esus4 E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D Dsus4 D              Asus2
My love is vengeance that's never free

E             Bm       A         E            Bm         G       D
 When my fist clenches crack it open before I use it and lose my cool
       Bm     A           D                 Bm        A          E   Bm  A
When I smile tell me some bad news before I laugh and act like a fool
E         Bm      A        E             Bm     G       D
 And if I swallow anything evil put your finger down my throat

C/G                   Am/E                      F
Love of mine, someday you will die, but I'll be close behind

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white, just our hands clasped so tight
        C                 G
Waiting for the hint of a spark

   Am                C              F             C   C/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
     Am            C             G
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
   Am               C                  E      Am   G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

Then I'll follow you into the dark

   C/G                            Am/E                 F
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule, I got my knuckles bruised
     C       G
by a lady in black
      C/G                   Am/E                       F
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son, fear is the heart of love"

So I never went back

   Am                C              F             C   C/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied

If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

C/G                       Am/E                         F
You and me have seen everything to see from Bangkok to Calgary
        C             G
And the soles of your shoes
    C/G                         Am/E                          F
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now, it's nothing to cry about
            C               G
Cause we'll hold each other soon
    Am          F
The blackest of rooms

       Am                C              F             C   C/B
And if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied

And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs

If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

Chorus- C D G Em C D G

G               C   G                D
 Hey where did we go days when the rains came?
G             C    G           D
 Down in the hollow playing a new game
G             C                G               D
 Laughing and running, hey hey, skipping and a jumping
G              C              G       D
 In the misty morning fog with our a-hearts a-thumping
    C   D              G      Em
And you, my brown eyed girl
C       D           G      D
 You, my brown eyed girl

G          C      G                D
 Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G                C             G            D
 Going down the old mine with a transistor radio
G                C                 G                  D
 Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind the rainbow's wall
G               C      G              D
 Slipping and a-sliding all along the waterfall
     C   D              G      Em
With you, my brown eyed girl
C       D           G
 You, my brown eyed girl

 Do you remember when we used to sing
G          C           G              D
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-te-da. Just like that

G            C         G                  D
 So hard to find my way now that I'm all on my own
G                    C        G        D
 I saw you just the other day, my, how you have grown
G                C               G                D
 Cast my memory back there, Lord. Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about it
G                   C          G           D
 Making love in the green grass behind the stadium
     C   D              G      Em
With you, my brown eyed girl
C       D           G
 You, my brown eyed girl

 Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Am               D                Fmaj7               G
 Will it make it easier on you now you got someone to blame?

         C         Am        Fmaj7              C
You say, "One love, one life, when it's one need in the night."
         Am                  Fmaj7                     C
One love, we get to share it, it leaves you baby if you don't care for it

| Am | D | Fmaj7 | G |

Am         D         Fmaj7                        G
 Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                      D       Fmaj7                      G
 You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.

          C         Am      Fmaj7                C
Well, it's too late, tonight to drag the past out into the light
                    Am                      Fmaj7                C
We're one, but we're not the same, we get to carry each other, carry each other. One

| Am | D | Fmaj7 | G |

Am                        D         Fmaj7               G
 Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                         D     Fmaj7                 G
 Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?

C                  Am               Fmaj7                         C
 Did I ask to much, more than a lot? You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
                    Am                     Fmaj7                     C
We're one, but we're not the same. Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

        C                  Am
You say, "Love is a temple, love a higher law."
C                 Am
"Love is a temple, love the higher law."
    C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
                        Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt

C         Am        Fmaj7                  C
 One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should
C        Am               Fmaj7    C
 One life with each other. Sisters, brothers
C                   Am                      Fmaj7                 C
 One life, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other. One

 Am                    Em   F   C
Bury all your secrets in my skin
 Am                        Em  F                   C
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
 Am                         Em       F   C
The air around me still feels like a cage
 Am                           Em   F                       C
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…

[Chorus]
                        G                       Am
So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.

My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.
                    G                            Am
Deliver me into my Fate - If I'm alone I cannot hate
                       G
I don't deserve to have you…
    F                                                     Am
My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

    Am                   Em      F   C
I still press your letters to my lips
     Am                        Em     F              C
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
   Am                         Em    F    C
I couldn't face a life without your light
    Am                            Em   F                   C
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight

                                G                              Am
So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                          G                                 Am
You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                            G                                   Am
I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                          G
I never claimed to be a Saint…
    F                                                            Am
My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go

Am Em F C
 
[Chorus]
                              G
So Break Yourself Against My Stones
                         Am
And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
                     G
You Never Needed Any Help
                         Am
You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
                       G
And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
                            Am
You Ran Away - You're All The Same
                   G
Angels Lie To Keep Control…

My Love Was Punished Long Ago
                                     A5 B5 C5 E5 F5
If You Still Care, Don't Ever Let Me Know

If you still care, don't ever let me know…

# Through the glass


```
                           C
I'm looking at you through the glass
 
 
[Chorus]
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                Em
Oh God, it feels   like forever
                                  C
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
D                           Em
Sitting all alone inside your   head
                                  C
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
 
 
[Verse 1]
           C                     D
How do you feel? That is the question
         Em
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
     C                              D
When something like a soul becomes initialized
                   Em
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope
C
And while you're outside looking in
D
Describing what you see
  Em
Remember what you're staring at is me
                                 C
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
 
 
[Chorus]
                        D                                Em
Don't know how much time  has passed AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
 
 
[Verse 2]
            C                    D
How much is real? So much to question
      Em
An epidemic of the mannequins Contaminating everything
     C
When thought came from the heart
   D                             Em
It never did right from the start Just listen to the noises
No more sad voices
C                             D
Before you tell yourself It's just a different scene
  Em
Remember it's just different from what you've seen
 
 
[Chorus]
                           C                                 D
I'm looking at you through the glass Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
                                  C
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                        D
Don't know how much time  has passed
                     Em
AllI know is that it feels like forever
                                   C                    D                           Em
When no one ever tells you that forever feels like home Sitting all alone inside your   head
             C
And it's the stars

         C                         Em                       Fmaj7
He said "Son, have you seen the world? Well, what would you say
                    C                    Fmaj7                      C
if I said that you could? Just carry this gun and you'll even get paid"
C                           G
 I said "That sounds pretty good"
              C                      Em
Black leather boots, spitshined so  bright
                    Fsus2               C
They cut off my hair     but it looks alright
             
We marched and we sang
Fsus2
     We all became friends
C                     G
 As we learned how to fight

```
**Estribillo** 
``` 
           Am                       Fmaj7                   C
A hero of war, Yeah that's what I'll be, and when I come home
                          G                   Am                    Fmaj7
They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag, to the grave if I must
                          C                          G
'cause it's a flag that I love, and a flag that I trust

```
**Estrofa** 
``` 
 
[Verse 3]
I kicked in the door
C
 I yelled my commands
Em
   The children, they cried
Fsus2            C
     But I got my man
We took him away
Fsus2
     A bag over his face
C                        G
 From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes
 
 
[Verse 4]
C                   Em                    Fmaj7                   C
 They pissed in his hands, I told them to stop, but then I joined in
                 Fmaj7                       C                   G 
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once, but again and again
 

```
**Estribillo** 
``` 
           Am                       Fmaj7                   C
A hero of war, Yeah that's what I'll be, and when I come home
                          G                   Am                    Fmaj7
They'll be damn proud of me. I'll carry this flag, to the grave if I must
                          C                          G
'cause it's a flag that I love, and a flag that I trust
 
Fmaj7 G
```
**Estrofa**
``` 

    Csus2                      Em
She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
Fadd11                C
      I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
Fadd11               C
      So I lifted my gun
             G
And I fired away
 
 
[Verse 6]
              C
And the shells jumped through the smoke
Em
   And into the sand
Fsus2                       C
     That the blood now had soaked
             Fsus2                   C
She collapsed     with a flag in her hand
                G
A flag white as snow
A hero of war

```
**Estribillo** 
``` 
           Am                    Fmaj7                   C
A hero of war, Is that what they see , Just medals and scars
                   G                          Am                    Fmaj7
 So damn proud of me. And I brought home that flag, Now it gathers dust
                        C                          G
But it's a flag that I love, It's the only flag I trust
 
 
```
**Final**
``` 
         Am                        Em                       Fmaj7                
He said, "Son, have you seen the world? Well what would you say,  
                    C
if I said that you could?"
