[Verse 1]
 
C                  Em               Am     Em
  I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care,
            Bm                    C
but it's so cold and I don't know where
              Em              Am        Em
I brought you daffodils, on a pretty string,
               Bm                     C         C
but they won't flower like they did last spring
C             Em                 Am     Em
  And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright,
                Bm                C
but I'm just so tired to share my nights
        Em        Am     Em
I wanna cry and I wanna love
           Bm                C     C
But all my tears have been used up
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                G             Em
  On another love, another love
       Bm                   C
All my tears have been used up,
               G            Em
on another love, another love
       Bm                   C
All my tears have been used up,
              G              Em
on another love, another love
       Bm                   C       G
All my tears have been used uuuhuuuhuuup
 
Em  Bm
Ooohoooh

[Verse 2]
 
C                 Em               Am    Em
  And if somebody hurts you, yeah I wanna fight,
                  Bm                  C
but my hands been broken one too many times
            Em                Am      Em
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
                  Bm                   C
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
               Em              Am      Em
And I'd sing a song that would be just ours,
               Bm             C
but I sang 'em all to another heart
            Em          Am       Em
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love,
           Bm                   C
but all my tears have been used up
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                G            Em
On another love, another love
       Bm                   C
All my tears have been used up,
               G             Em
on another love, another love
       Bm                   C
All my tears have been used up,
               G             Em
on another love, another love
       Bm                   C       G
All my tears have been used uuuhuuuhuuup ah
 
Em  Bm
Ooohoooh

 I wanna sing a song that would be just ours,
               Bm             C
but I sang 'em all to another heart
            Em          Am      Em
And I wanna cry I wanna fall in love,
           Bm                   C
but all my tears have been used up

All my tears have been used up,
               G             Em
on another love, another love
       Bm                   C       G
All my tears have been used uuuhuuuhuuup
