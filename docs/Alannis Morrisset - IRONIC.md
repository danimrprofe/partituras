An old man turned ninety-eight
            D5/F#  G5   D5/F#         Em
He won the lottery and died the next day
         D5/F# G5    D5/F#       Em
It's a black fly in your chardonnay
        D5/F#     G5         D5/F#      Em
It's a death row pardon two minutes to late
           D5/F#  G5       D5/F#    Em
Isn't it ironic...  don't you...  think

It's like rain. On your wedding day
             D  G5            D        Em
It's a free ride  when you've already paid
                 D  G5          D           Em
It's the good advice  that you just didn't take
  F  C/E   D7(4/9)   C              D
Who would've       thought... it figures

Mr. play it safe was afraid to fly
               D5/F# G5            D5/F#         Em
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
                D5/F#     G5           D5/F#      Em
He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight
             D5/F#        G5            
And as the plane crashed down, he thought 
      D5/F#       Em
"Well, isn't this nice"
           D5/F#  G5       D5/F#    Em

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
                                  
When you think everything is okay 
      C7M                    D6(11)
And everything's going right
     C7M                                D6(11)
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
                                   
You think everything's gone wrong 
      C7M
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
       D5/F#  G5           D5/F#      Em
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
           D5/F#         G5                 D5/F#      Em
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
D5/F#             G5                    D5/F#                 Em
It's meeting the man of my dreams then meeting his beautiful wife

           D5/F#  G5       D5/F#    Em
Isn't it ironic...  don't you...  think
          D5/F#    G5          D5/F#      Em
A little too ironic... yeah I really do think
