[Intro]
A  Em  D
A  Em  D
 
[Verse]
A                       Em
Run and tell all of the angels
D
This could take all night
A                       Em                 D
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
A                    Em
Hook me up a new revolution
     D
Cause this one is a lie
   A                        Em                    D
We sat around laughing, and watching the last one die
 
[Chorus]
    A                     Em
I'm looking to the sky to save me
D
Looking for a sign of life
A                        Em              D
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
A                      Em
I'm looking for a complication
D
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
F                G                 A
Make my way back home and learn to fly
 
[Instrumental]
A  Em   D
A  Em   D
 
[Verse]
A                      Em
Think I'm done nursing the patience,
D
It could wait one night.
A                        Em              D
Give it all away if you give me one last try
A               Em             D
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life.
A                            Em               D
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright.
 
[Chorus]

I'm looking to the sky to save me,
D
Looking for a sign of life.
A                        Em             D
Looking for something to help me burnout bright.
    A                  Em
I'm looking for a complication,
D
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying.
F                G                    D
Make my way back home when I learn to fly.
F                G                    A
Make my way back home when I learn to fly....

Try to make this life my own.
A       F               C                   D
Fly.....along with me I can't quite make it alone.
